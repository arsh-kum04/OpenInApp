ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
#The project follows contemporary Android development principles and adopts a single activity architecture to improve scalability and maintenance convenience.

#It employs the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, which offers several benefits including Separation of Concerns, Testability, Data Binding, Reactive Programming, #Maintainability, Scalability, and Code Reusability.

#The OpenInApp project integrates various essential components such as Navigation, Single Activity Architecture, MVVM, LiveData, Coroutines, synergizing to enhance the project's #functionality and organization.
#For visualizing data in a graph, the project utilizes the MpChart library, presenting the data over a one-month timeframe in accordance with the provided API specifications.

MY EXPERIENCE & THINGS I LEARNED :

#Reflecting on the past two days of this assignment, I'm struck by how much can be learned and accomplished in such a short timeframe. Starting with only basic knowledge of Kotlin, I #embarked on this journey and delved into the world of APIs, Retrofit handlers, LiveData, data models, MVVM architecture, singleton architecture, synchronous and asynchronous calls, #fragments, and navigation between them.

#However, it didn't end there. I also experimented with data visualisation by utilising the MpChart library, discovered the potential of Coroutines, and improved my ability to create #stunning UI/UX designs.
#It really is amazing how one project can lead to so many new abilities and perspectives.
